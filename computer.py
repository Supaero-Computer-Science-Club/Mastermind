    Minmax method proceeeds as follow : 
        1) Produce all possibles codes, and let S* be the set of all possible codes,
           and S the set of possible winning codes, such as at step 1, S = S*
        2) Start with a code from S (1122 for original Mastermind )
        3) Play the guess to get a score : (right color, right color & position)
        4) If it is the right code, the game is won and the algorithm ends.
        5) Otherwise, remove from S* any code that would not give the same result if
           it was the secret code.
        6) Apply minmax technique to get the next guess, as follow :
            - For each unused guess in S, count how many elements of S*
              would lead to a certain score (x, y), for all possible scores.
            - Create a set which contains the guesses that lead to the minimum
              maximum number of elements left in S*
            - Take one of them (first one for determinism), and repeat from step 3.
